pcdr module: https://pypi.org/project/pcdr/

At time of writing, the pcdr module's source is hosted as [a subfolder of the sdr-course repo](https://github.com/python-can-define-radio/sdr-course/tree/main/classroom_activities/Chx_Misc/Python_curric_2). During the months of April and May 2024, we will be migrating the code to this repo.
