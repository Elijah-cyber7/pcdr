Pub/Sub works on WSL. When we tried to extract the relevant parts for easier Python use, it doesn't seem to connect. No error messages.

Next steps:
-> Try the basic pub/sub "models" on James-pcdr's computer to ensure those work.
-> Use debugger to step through our simplified publisher; see if can determine source of error.

Goal:
- Allow for testing without the Hack RF
--> Set up pcdr functions to connect to waterfall sink in GNU RAdio
	Example:
		from pcdr import stuff
		modulated = ook_modulate([1,0,1,0], bit_length=1000)
		gnuradio_view_waterfall(modulated, samp_rate=2e6)
--> Step 1: create gnuradio_view_waterfall()
     Step 1a: Open GNU Radio, Generate a flowgraph with a waterfall, and figure out the python code    

--> Set up pcdr functions to write to file (for any that don't already)
--> Sending OOK (done)
--> Receiving & demodulating OOK (harder, not done)
--> Sending FM transmission (not done)
  - Benefits over GRC:
    - Easily make a frequency-hopping FM transmitter/jammer (for example, to degrade multiple walkie talkie channels or multiple radio stations)
    - Easily make a auto-song-changing FM transmitter
--> Activity detector
  - description: 
    - if received amplitude passes a certain threshold, then
      - make a log in a text file of what MHz it was, how long it was above that threshold, and the relative power level
      - record the signal (if desired)
  - Building blocks of this: Receiver (done), averaging the amplitude??? need to figure that out

--> possibly expand additional practice `pcdr.wavegen.generate_ook_modulated_example_data` code to include multiple signal generation in urh lessons
