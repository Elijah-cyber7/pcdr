TODO: Have exercises for...

- Concatenating different signals
  - Including concatenating some preliminary silence -- point out that this is useful for testing, and we used this when we made the URH exercises
- Rescaling signals (constant multiple)
- Adding two signals (Do this with real-valued sigs)
- FM Transmit:
  - Send, then wait, then send -- simulated conversation
  - Send with lower amplitude to simulate being further away
- GUI Zero:
  - FM Transmit with text box for file name of wav file to send
- ?Multiplying complex waves?
