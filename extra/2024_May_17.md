- I had a "window receiver" in one of my notes from early April 2024. If I end up implementing that, I want to call it "chunk receiver" or similar.
- I may make a receiver that has nothing initially attached -- one would add stuff using .connect_probe(), .connect_zmq_pub(), or similar.
- ZMQ pub idea is something like this: a Python flowgraph publishes data using zmq, and a GRC-created flowgraph receives that data and does something such as putting it on a GUI sink.
